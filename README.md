# Data Viewer App

This is a **Data Viewer App** built using **React**, **Material UI** for styling, and **Redux Toolkit** for state management. The application provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing data through tables, charts, and navigation.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live version of the app [https://dataviewer12.netlify.app/](https://dataviewer12.netlify.app/).

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Key Features

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**: The app uses Redux Toolkit to manage global state, allowing components to easily access and modify shared data.
- **UI Components with Material UI**: Material UI is used to style the app, including the creation of tables, a navigation bar, and other UI components.
- **Data Visualization with React Chart.js**: The app leverages React Chart.js to render interactive and visually appealing charts for better data presentation.
- **Routing with React Router**: React Router is used for routing, providing seamless navigation between different sections of the app.

## Future Enhancements

- If I had more time (approximately four additional hours), I would focus on:
  - Creating **reusable components** to make the code more efficient and modular.
  - Implementing a **backend** to handle authentication and authorization for secure user access.
  - Storing data in a **database** to ensure persistence and allow users to save and retrieve their data.
  - Introducing **sales units** for different stores, enabling better management and segmentation of data.
